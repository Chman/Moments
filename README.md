# Moments 2: Electric Boogaloo
This is my personal fork of Chman's Moments, all I did was fix the script that was causing problems.  
As per request of the licence, what I changed was MinDrawer.cs,   
I removed it because new Unity versions already come with this as part of the engine.  
  
This is a modified version of the original,  
the original licence & most licence notices have been left intact, though one was removed in the process of modification.  



# Moments - Original Description
**Moments** is a quick GIF replay recorder for Unity3D. It automatically records the last few seconds of gameplay and lets you save to a GIF file on demand, like the game [TowerFall Ascension](http://www.towerfall-game.com/) does.

Tested with Unity 4.6. The demo requires Unity 5+ (Personal or Pro).

## Instructions

Drop the `Moments Recorder` folder in your project and add the `Recorder` script to your camera (or select your camera and use `Component -> Miscellaneous -> Moments Recorder`).

The included demo should get you started. For more advanced features, browse the `Moments.Recorder` source code, it's heavily commented.
