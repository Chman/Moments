# Unity-Moments

Updated version of the following repository by [Chman](https://github.com/Chman/Moments)
**Moments** is a quick GIF replay recorder for Unity. It automatically records the last few seconds of gameplay and lets you save to a GIF file on demand.

Tested with Unity 2022.1. The demo requires use of the Universal or High Definition Render Pipelines.

## Instructions

Drop the `Moments Recorder` folder in your project and add the `Recorder` script to your camera (or select your camera and use `Component -> Miscellaneous -> Moments Recorder`).

The included demo should get you started. For more advanced features, browse the `Moments.Recorder` source code, it's heavily commented.
